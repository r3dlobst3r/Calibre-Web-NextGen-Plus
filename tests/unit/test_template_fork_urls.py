"""Regression test for fork issue #141 — user-facing template URLs that
direct users to project resources (release notes, issue tracker, project
home) must point at ``new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen``, not upstream.

Cherry-picks from ``crocodilestick/Calibre-Web-Automated`` keep
reintroducing the upstream URL into ``cps/templates/`` — the "See
Changelog" link in the in-app update banner, the "Create Issue" link on
error pages, and the "CWA GitHub" admin button were all still pointing
at upstream months after the fork detached. This test pins them.

Allowed upstream references (attribution + docs we don't have our own
copy of yet) are listed explicitly so the test doesn't fight legitimate
credit lines. Add to ``ALLOWED_UPSTREAM_REFS`` only with operator
review — anything new should default to the fork URL.
